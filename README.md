My-Personal-Page

For this project, I basically just made a page for myself.
I incorporated a mixture of html, css from bootstrap, google fonts, and my own css style sheets.
I made three separate html files titled: 'About Derek', 'Derek's Portfolio', and 'Contact Derek.'
There html file links are named: index.html, portfolio.html, and contact.html.
Each page is equip with a navbar that includes links to one another, so you can navigate back and forth between the pages.
The About Derek page includes a photo of my as well as just a brief intro to myself.
The portfolio page is designed to feature new projects I make as I complete them.
The contact page is meant to serve as a way to reach me through email. While the form doesnt exactly work, clicking submit will link you to my email adress.
This project was a lot of fun and helped me to learn how to use html and css bootstap more!
